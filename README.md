### Analysis of Income and Credit Score
 
## Goal:
 
I want to see if there is a relationship between income level (after taxes), and financial responsibility. To measure financial responsibility we can use the average amount of days a payment was delayed past the due date.
 
## Methodology:
 
We will plot a simple line graph with income on X-Axis and credit score on Y-Axis.
 
 
 
 
## Evaluation:
 
The strength of the relationship can be measured with the concentration of data points.
 
 
## Results:
 
Upon looking at Results.png, we can see that the highest concentration of dots is where the average take home pay is less than 6000$ USD, and the amount of days between debt due and payment date, is below 30. This makes sense, as people with less money have a harder time making payments on date.
 
On the other hand, a future study might be if there is a correlation, between take home pay and average credit card debt, because this would let us discern whether the higher concentration of dots, is due to fiscal irresponsibility on the part of lower income earners, because we could compare the total average credit card debt across income levels.  If there was a constant amount of average debt, across income levels, it could be reasonably said that even those with lower income levels, their spending habits don't change and that is cause for concern, as you should only spend in proportion to what you earn.
 
That opens up another door, if the total spending of lower income earners is wants or needs. If it's spent on rent, that is required, but if it's spent on quality of life things, like nicer phones, laptops, or nicer home amenities like dishes, plates.
